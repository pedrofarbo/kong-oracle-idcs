    This plugin uses the Oracle IDCS introspection endpoint to validate tokens and
    supports multiple clients, scope validation, and robust error handling.
    
    Version 0.2.2 improvements:
    - Fixed bug where only the first configured client was being validated
    - Added support for multiple client validation (tries all clients until one succeeds)
    - Improved logging with debug level for detailed information
    - Added token 'active' field validation
    - Enhanced error handling with better error messages
    - Added JSON decode error protection
